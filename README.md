Note: Please excuse the presently sloppy repo! I am learning Git and Github and hope to have a clean and usable repo as soon as possible. 

Currently, all work has been done in parallel jupyter notebooks. I will keep my (Kurt's) most updated notebook in the main folder of this Repo, but I am working to modularize the code and set ourselves up to quickly experiment new directions.
